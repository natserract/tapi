# TAPI

Designing backend architecture with types. *"stronger is your type system more flexibility you get!"*

## Introduction
Haskell its powerful type system its a great support for type-level programming. Type-level Programming (TLP) is writing programs that run at compile-time, 
unlike term-level programming which is writing programs that run at run-time. Types can turn possible runtime errors into compile-time errors.

## Goals
Learn and self-implement type level programming. *I know, Haskell has high learning curve, its hard to grasp. But it never hurts to try right?"*. Last but  not least, if you doing this? it's like being a scientist.
